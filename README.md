# Guia-definitivo-do-Python-Projetos

This repository contains 30+ projects and is intended to be studied after completing the "Guia Definitivo do Python" course (in an ideal scenario). However, if you already know Python and are curious about how the projects were built, feel free to explore.

My main goal with this repository is to create a portfolio to show to other people what I am able to do as a programmer. In the same way, by studying these projects, you will become a better programmer in Python. So it is a win-win scenario.

All the projects in this repository come in different forms. They start simple and gradually become more complex and professional. Not all code follows the same design or structure, and it does not need to be large or overly complex. The main goal is to demonstrate how the same program can be written in multiple ways.

You are expected to already have Python knowledge to fully understand the projects. I do not explain every detail or every library used. Instead, I focus on explaining what each project is about and why I created three, four, or even more versions of it.

The intention is to help you understand different approaches, improve your problem-solving skills, develop better coding practices over time, and **show my work for the World**.
